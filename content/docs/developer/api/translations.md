title: Translations
---

The **Translations** endpoint allows you to translate text or speech between languages using supported language models.

This feature is **optional** and may not be enabled in all Cube AI deployments. It is useful when building applications that need multilingual support, such as:

- automatic subtitle generation
- multilingual chat assistants
- real-time translation of audio or text
- support for international users

> **Cube AI scope**
>
> Cube AI provides **secure translation execution inside Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)**.
> It does **not** train or fine-tune translation models, nor does it host language model training pipelines.
> Model availability and supported languages depend on backend configuration.

## How It Works

![Cube AI translations flow](/img/translations-flow.png)

When you call the Translations endpoint:

1. Your input (text or audio) is sent securely to Cube AI.
2. The request is processed by a language model that supports translation.
3. The translated output is returned.

All processing runs inside a **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)**, ensuring that input data and translated output remain confidential.

## Use Cases

- **Text Translation:** Convert text from one language to another.
- **Speech Translation:** Translate spoken audio into text in another language.
- **Multilingual Interfaces:** Add translation support to apps, bots, or UIs.
- **Accessibility:** Automatic subtitle or caption translation.

---

All requests are authenticated using **Personal Access Tokens (PATs)**.

## Endpoint

```http
POST /proxy/{domain_id}/v1/audio/translations
```

> Note: Some deployments may also expose a **text-only translations** endpoint (e.g., `/v1/translations`) depending on backend and configuration.

---

## Example Request (Audio)

Translate an audio file (e.g., WAV) using a model that supports speech recognition and translation:

```bash
curl -k https://localhost/proxy/<domain_id>/v1/audio/translations   -H "Authorization: Bearer <pat>"   -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data"   -F "file=@speech.wav"   -F "model=whisper-1"
```

---

## Example Request (Text)

Translate a text string between languages:

```bash
curl -k https://localhost/proxy/<domain_id>/v1/translations   -H "Authorization: Bearer <pat>"   -H "Content-Type: application/json"   -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini-translator",
    "source_language": "en",
    "target_language": "sr",
    "input": "Hello, how are you?"
  }'
```

> Adjust the endpoint path as configured in your deployment.

---

## Response

Returns an object containing the translated text (or text result from audio).

Example (text translation):

```json
{
  "object": "translation",
  "input": "Hello, how are you?",
  "translation": "Zdravo, kako si?"
}
```

## Notes

- Requests are authenticated using **Personal Access Tokens (PATs)**
- Translations run inside a **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)**.
- Supported models and languages depend on backend configuration (Ollama / vLLM).
- Cube AI does **not** define new languages — it exposes models that support translation.
- Use this feature when your application needs **secure, multilingual capabilities**.

## Next Steps

- Combine with **Chat Completions** for real-time multilingual chat
- Integrate into UI for user-facing translation support
- Use with **Embeddings** for cross-lingual semantic search
