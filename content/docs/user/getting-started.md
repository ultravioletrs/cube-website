## Getting Started

This guide introduces the basics of Cube AI using the web interface.
Additional access methods such as APIs, CLI tools, and IDE integrations are covered in later sections.

---

## 1. Start Cube AI

Start the Cube AI stack.
Make sure Docker is running before executing this command.

```bash
make up
```

Once the services are running, open your browser and navigate to:

```http
https://localhost
```

You should now see the Cube AI login screen.

## 2. Log In as Administrator

Use the default development credentials:

- **Email:** `admin@example.com`
- **Password:** `m2N2Lfno`

> These credentials are for **local development only**.  
> Production deployments require custom administrator accounts.

After logging in, you will land on the Cube AI dashboard.

---

## 3. Create a Domain

A **domain** acts as an isolated workspace for users, models, and LLM operations.

To create a domain:

1. From the dashboard, click **Create Domain**
2. Enter a **Name** and **Route**
3. Click **Create**
4. When the domain appears in the list, click **Open Domain**

You are now inside your new domain.

## 4. Open the Chat Interface

Inside your domain workspace:

1. Use the left navigation menu
2. Click **Chat**

This will open the interactive chat interface powered by Cube AI.

---

## 5. Send Your First Message

Type a message into the chat input and press **Enter**.

Example prompts:

- "Hello!"
- "Explain how trusted execution environments work."
- "Write a Python function that reverses a list."

Cube AI will generate a response using the default LLM backend (Ollama unless configured otherwise).

---

## 6. Switch Models (Optional)

If multiple models are available:

1. Click the **Model Selector** at the top of the chat page
2. Choose a different LLM (for example: TinyLlama, Starcoder, Qwen)

Cube AI will switch inference to the selected model.
Available models depend on your backend configuration (Ollama or vLLM).

---

## 7. Create a Personal Access Token (PAT)

For API usage, integrations, and development workflows, Cube AI uses **Personal Access Tokens (PATs)**.

To create a PAT:

1. Click your profile avatar in the top-right corner
2. Open **Profile → Personal Access Tokens**
3. Click **Create Token**
4. Copy and store the token securely

> PATs are **long-lived tokens** and are the recommended authentication method
> for all external API access.

---

## 8. What's Next?

Now that you have created a domain and used the chat interface, you can explore:

- Managing users
- Assigning roles
- Creating additional domains
- Backend configuration (Ollama / vLLM)
- API access using Personal Access Tokens (PATs)
